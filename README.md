## Recommendations

* HPE has won awards for diversity, but I think that the company could be more transparent about its goals. Also, the HPE could be more innovative and focus on ideas. 
* I think the HPE Ezmeral could be a beneficiary for the customers and the company because it offers enterprise-grade security and access controls, as well as model governance and auditability. It also helps enterprises unify, modernize, and analyze data from edge to cloud.
*  The HPE uses the open-source Kubernetes technology, which is a system that automates the management, scaling, and deployment of containerized applications.
* I am sure the technology of automation and optimization of the management, scaling, and deployment system will be used everywhere soon. Also, I think this is a good tool to make an enterprise company's business reliable.
